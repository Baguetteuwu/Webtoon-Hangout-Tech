      "description": "> You can take a test once ur all caught up on a webtoon, and you’ll be tested by one of our testers. \n\n> A test consists of three short questions related to the webtoon you’re being tested on, going in order from the beginning of the story to the middle, and then the end (or latest chapter, if the webtoon has not yet been completed). If you answer a question incorrectly, we’ll add another question to make up for it. Answer that one wrong, and we’ll add another question with a maximum of five. \n\n> At the moment, there are more than 50 roles you can apply to be tested for, but we’re working on adding more.\n\n> To submit a request for a test, follow instructions in <#730531385235734591>",
